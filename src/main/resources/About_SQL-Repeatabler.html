<br>
<br>This tool changes SQL-Scripts, which
<br>are generated by lo-code platform 'Appian',
<br>to MS flavour amd makes them runable repeatedly.
<br>I.e. a 'create table' should not generate a
<br>'table already exists' error when running the
<br>second time.
<br>The converted scripts are intended to be used
<br>in a deployment system that wants to execute
<br>them more than once.
<br>This tool only covers those commands that
<br>Appian has confronted us with so far.
