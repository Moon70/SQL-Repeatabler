<br>
<br>This tool enhances SQL-Scripts (MS flavour), which are generated by lo-code
<br>platform 'Appian', to make them runable repeatedly.
<br>I.e. a 'create table' should not generate a 'table already exists'
<br>error when running another time.
<br>The converted scripts are intended to be used in a deployment
<br>system that wants to execute them more than once.
<br>This tool only covers the SQL commands that Appian has
<br>confronted us with so far and will only be enhanced as needed.
